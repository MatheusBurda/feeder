# feeder

Feeder is an IOT project, which goal is to automatically feed pets. 
A ReactNative APP was developed to set the feeding times, in addition to an API that saves and transmits this information to an ESP-8266 board, which controls the feeding process itself.
There`s a Youtube video showing how it works [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQD6tmM5PWs).
